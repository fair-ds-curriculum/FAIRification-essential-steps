## Introduction
Many of the decisions that need to be made in the FAIRification process happen
within the context of a specific project, a specific organization, via a
specific funding agency, and within a specific knowledge domain. These factors
will impact time-frames, budgets, and other resources that are needed for 
FAIRifiction.

Several studies have shown that a lot of time in research is used to make data
interoperable, and that much of this time could be saved with a better data
infrastructure:

- Data pros waste half of their work time chasing costly data
- There was a other article... Rajaram h
- RDA Survey​ indicating that data scientists spend 75% of their time data wrangling
- Crowdflower report​ names number of 79% data wrangling in industry
- Brodie [M. L. Brodie, Understanding Data Science: An Emerging Discipline for Data-Intensive Discovery, keynote, Proc.of the XVII Int’l Conf Data Analytics and Management in Data Intensive Domains (DAMDID’2015), Obninsk, Russia, October
13-16, 2015.] comes up with a number of 80%

The FAIR principles, on purpose, did not make a choice for any particular
technical implementation of FAIR data. However, as many data scientists who
read the principles can point out, there is currently only one mature
technology that is considered suitable to tackle the challenge: the semantic
web. This is the technology we have chosen to focus on for our own
implementation. We hope that the critical mass we put behind these developments
will induce others to join us in this choice, as this will in our opinion give
a better chance for higher interoperability than parallel developments using different FAIR technologies.
