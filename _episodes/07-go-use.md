# 7. GO USE: Making your data machine actionable (operational?) 

## INTRODUCTION 

- So what can now be done Answer driving questions (interoperation, search, analysis)

*Andra says: the community needs to start ‘using’ FAIR data*

### GO CHANGE (policy that needs to be revised)


### GO TRAIN (skills that need to be learned) 

- Storage issues: for example… data in triple store  
- Search / Analysis
1.7 SPARQL
1.8 GO FAIR Search Engine ? 
1.9 RD-Connect Demonstrator ? 
1.10 Previous BYOD results: ONCO XL, DSM ? 
1.11 Show variant assessment application using Euretos + SeDEx
1.12 Solution for making queries without knowledge of SPARQL: BioQuery 

To increase Findability: 
The vision is to have (meta)data on a FDP indexed by many different search engines. This indexing services would allow for fine-grained search of relevant data. However, before such search engines become available, GO FAIR will work with INs to create a registry of FDPs. 
GO BUILD (tools that need to be developed).

To increase Interoperability:
The vision is to answer a driving user question, thus making the data interoperable. Here, SPARQL queries should be generated.



## REFERENCES

- The Lorentz Workshop [ or https://fair-demo.fair-dtls.surf-hosted.nl ] had participants with different 12 datasets (on OSF and the FDP). So it was like a super-BYOD. As the Workshop was only one week in duration, we attempted to do the FAIRifications as a DIY project. In the 8 weeks leading up to the actual Workshop, the participants were contacted by email with instructions, documents and webinars so they could try each step of the FAIRfication on their own. The series of emails now provide a kind of step-by-step process that we can re-use to make a more definitive list of tasks. The documentation created for the Lorentz event have now been collated into this DIY FAIR Tutorial.
