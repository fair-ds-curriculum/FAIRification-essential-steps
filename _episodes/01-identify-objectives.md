# Introduction

Before you start you should identify the objective of FAIRifying your data:
Why do you want your data to be FAIR? Answering this question sets the scope
for the FAIRification process. Although, it is always recommended that all
components of FAIR are considered (or at least partially each of the four
foundational principles), FAIRification is aspirational and it is therefore
the choice of each stakeholder to set the scope. There is currently no defined
limitation for sets of FAIRification scopes. Below you can see a few examples:

1. As a data owner, I want my data to be FAIR, because I need to satisfy some
requirements.
2. As a researcher, I want my data to be FAIR, because I need citations
(show impact)
3. As a ​?​, I want my data to be more interoperable: driving user questions
4. As a ​?​, I want my data to be more reusable, e.g. by defining access/use
conditions in
metadata
5. As a ​?​, I want other people to be able to find my data: focus on metadata
6. As a ​?​, I need more users for my software/framework/repository, otherwise
 it will be dead by the end of the year
7. As a researcher, I want my data to be FAIR (Reusable) because I am the
first re-user of my own data, notably when (a) I need to reproduce results
tomorrow (b) I need to answer questions from referees of my paper
(c) my postdoc leaves and the work is picked up by his/her successor
8. ...

Scope: Increased interoperability (driving user question).

It is wise to start of with FAIRifying a selection of your dataset
(if your data is big). This can mean that you FAIRify only a small number of
data records or data subjects, but more likely that you pick only a few
properties described in all data records to FAIRify first. For selecting the
right set, we propose phrasing a few driving research questions. Figure out
which data elements are required to answer your questions.

Reason for using driving user question (limitations for big data):

- Scalability: when you’re first starting this, you do not have a complete and efficient
infrastructure to deal with large amounts of data. It is very inefficient when your still trying out different ideas to do this with a large volume of data.
- Time: you will soon find out that the more values you look at, the more special cases you
will find to FAIRification rules you thought you discovered: if it would be an easy process, it would not be needed. Limiting the scope of your first efforts will balance cost and benefit.

# GO CHANGE (policy that needs to be revised)
- Some of these answers come from the top-down (requirements from funding agencies) while others come from the bottom-up (usefulness to researchers).
- GO FAIR Foundation is working at the international level (Renee) but also gathering use cases from researchers (Bert).
