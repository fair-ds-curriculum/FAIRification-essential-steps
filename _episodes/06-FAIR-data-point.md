# 6. Push to the FAIR Data Point / Compute FAIR Metrics and Metrics Scores 
## INTRODUCTION

A FAIR Data Point has two functions: (1) a publication platform for metadata (meaning that the persistence of the metadata is independent of the data), (2) to allow for fine-grained user controlled accessibility of (meta)data. 

As stated above, you can think of metadata as being more important than the data at least in regards to FAIRness (in the sense that the data may one day be deleted, but the metadata should always remain). The metadata (always machine-readable) will point to the data (Principle F3), whether that data is itself linkable. 

### GO CHANGE (policy that needs to be revised) 


### GO TRAIN (skills that need to be learned)

For (meta)data that are linkable, 
Push to FDP
Does your institution have FDPs?
What other options are there if your institution does not host a FDP?
Metadata should/can be pushed to the FDP early on

### GO BUILD (tools that need to be developed)
